        <p>My name is Andrew Griswold and I am a 24 year old aspiring programmer. I moved to Austin about two and a half years ago from New Hampshire with the intention 
          of learning as much about programming as I could. I got into computers as a kid, growing up playing super mario with my dad, I fell in love. Going on to mod 
          games like gta, I started building my own computers and was fascinated by every aspect of them. I love to learn new things and how everything works and what 
          people can make software do. The more I learn the more I want to know just exactly what is capable with technology and how we can shape the future with it. 
          I currently attend ACC as a computer science undergrad as well as the UT Austin BootCamp. I love robots. </p><p>My name is Andrew Griswold and I am a 24 year old aspiring programmer. I moved to Austin about two and a half years ago from New Hampshire with the intention
